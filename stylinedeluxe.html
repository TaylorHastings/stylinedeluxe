  	<p>During WWII almost every conceivable item was rationed by the 
  	United States Government. Food, personal care, paper, photo 
  	film, ink and nylon to name a few items. Many items vital 
  	to the production of automobiles was either heavily rationed 
  	or completely unavailable. Some of these items include:
	    
  	    <ul id="ration">
  	    	<li>metal
  	    	<li>fuel oil
  	    	<li>rubber (tires)
  	    	<li>gasoline
  	    	<li>grease
  	    	<li>kerosene
  	    	<li>industrial alcohol
  	    	<li>leather
  	    	<li>textiles (cloth)
  	    </ul>

	<p>Postwar auto production had seen manufactures issue touched-up versions of their 1942 cars.Some fresh designs had started coming out. In 1949 it was Chevrolet’s turn. In 1949, 
	 Chevrolet presented its first all new models since the end of World War II. The car had a lower, sleeker profile, with the lines of the front fenders smoothly blending into the doors
	 to be countered by the rear fenders that continued to bulge out of the sides of the car. A two-piece curved windshield improved vision and added to the overall sleek look.There were
	 14 new models divided into the Fleetline and Styleline series. The Styleline was represented by notchback styles of sedans, coupes, station wagons (Chevy’s last with structural-wood 
	 construction.), and a convertible. The 1949 cars came in two trim levels: including, the nicer DeLuxe. Fender skirts were 
	 part of the DeLuxe trim package.<p>
